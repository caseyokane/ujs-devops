## Branch 5 - Finale

You did it! <small>Or you just skipped to the end</small>. Either way, congrats! From here feel free to do whatever you
like. There is certainly much more room for improvement here. While feel free to take the repo in any direction you'd like
I'd recommend maybe adding additional components like a front-end UI, a database or even just dockerize things so that
you aren't reliant on Herkou's buildpacks.

Regardless, I'll collate any of the sources from the previous branches below:
